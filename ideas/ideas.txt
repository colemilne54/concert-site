add date to json

pre fill in addy for venue account type


null so try to get req body to print out. if thats not null its internal connection issue
if it is null, its how its trying to grab from server


10/26 to do moving foward:

current put is not how we want to display info or even take in

so 

change view reviews to more details
change put to almost final data (or at least first 2 entries)
then do the add concert for frontend
