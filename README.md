This read me serves as the basic file/ folder structure of our site.
From here our folder structure is straight forward:
the backend folder contains our backend code and the frontend folder contains our frontend code.

Within each folder is a separate readme outlining the structures of the two different folders.

Instructions for running:
cd into backend folder and run command "nodemon server"
cd into frontend folder and run command "npm start"
