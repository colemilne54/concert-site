# Frontend

This is our frontend code which is built using Reactjs.

## Public

Our public folder contains our index.html and any other files that need to be accessed by our other React code in the src folder.
The reason for things like our logo and favicon being placed here is that the way React references files.
They can't be in some random folder structure to be accessed, it wants these files only in the public folder

## Src

Our source folder is what contains the heart of our frontend.
